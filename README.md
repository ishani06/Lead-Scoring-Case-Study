# X Education Lead Scoring Project
# Objective
X Education aims to improve its lead conversion rate by identifying potential leads, also known as 'Hot Leads.' The company plans to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, facilitating more targeted communication efforts and higher conversion rates. The model should be adaptable to future changes and challenges outlined in a separate document.

# Steps Followed
Data Reading
 - Read the data from the provided CSV file.
Data Cleaning
 - Cleaned the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution, correlations, and key insights.
Creating Dummy Variables
 - Created dummy variables for categorical features.
Data Splitting
 - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Building (Logistic Regression)
 - Built a logistic regression model to predict lead scores.
Making Predictions
 - Made predictions using the trained model.
Model Evaluation
 - Evaluated the model using metrics such as ROC curve, Precision-Recall, etc.
Prediction on Test Set
 - Applied the model to the test set to assess its performance.
Final Presentation and Recommendations
 - Prepared a final presentation summarizing the analysis and providing recommendations.
